In this example, we obtained an unknown data configuration from other sources and would like
to know how it looks like, whether it can be run with a minimal settings in input script. 
First of all, we run in.check to see whether it can be run or not. Secondly, we use ovito to 
visualize the structure of the atoms. check_config.ovito is the ovito output status file. 
After installing ovito, we are able to open this file and visualize data.unknown.
