In this example, we generate a 2D plate with bond-type atoms in the fcc structure. We then
define regions of lower and upper parts, and apply forces on these parts with opposite 
directions (Within this script, we can also apply constant velocities). In the end, we dump
time series of atoms and make an animation with OVITO.
