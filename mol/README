This one we set a molecule constituted with three diffent kinds of atoms. There are two 
bonds of the same type in this molecule. To visualize the bond in OVITO, first we need 
to load data.mol into OVITO. After that, we apply load "trajectory feature" to load dump 
file. To avoid misleading breaking of bonds, we also suppressed the periodic boundary in
OVITO.
